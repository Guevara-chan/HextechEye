# ⋮Sum⋮
__HextechEye__ is an experimental [League of Legends](https://ru.leagueoflegends.com) match stat analyzer, made to predict best possible picks with current meta.  
Powered by [LeagueGraphs](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com) and [CoffeeScript v2](https://coffeescript.org/), it's development focuses on accessibility and up-to-date data acquisition.

# ⋮Featuræ⋮
* Pure frontend webscraping for latest match statistics.
* PS2-inspired minimalistic UI layout.
* CSV-based data import/export.
* Mostly [Codepen](http://codepen.io)-ready.

# ⋮Compatibility⋮
__HextechEye__  was best tested with _Chrome 70_ and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), which is used to develop it.  
Support for _Mozilla Firefox_ is mostly established, except for some UI disambiguation and [fixes](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Granting_JavaScript_access_to_the_clipboard) required to enable 'paste' btn.  
_Edge_ is generally broken beyond any hopes and not currently meant to be used with this webapp.
